This is a simple repository created while studying the course at egghead called __Modern JavaScript Tooling__.

### Addding webpack

1. initiated a node project with `npm init`
2. installed webpack with `npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli`
3. after installing, I created a script under package json to make it easier to build the project with webpack. This allows the command `npm run build -- --mode development`
4. added a simple module and imported it within `index.js` and verified the result at `dist` directory.
